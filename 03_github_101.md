# GitHub 101

#### What is GitHub Enterprise (GHE)?
GitHub Enterprise is the on-premises version of GitHub.com

#### How is GitHub Enterprise different from GitHub.com?
GitHub Enterprise  includes the same great set of features as GitHub.com but packaged for running on your organization's local network. All repository data is stored on machines that you control, and access is integrated with your organization's authentication system (LDAP, SAML, or CAS).

### Want to learn more about git & github?

Give it a try for yourself at github.com, all skills and capabilities will translate 100% to GHE.

### Example #1

#### Create a repository

```

#### Next `aaa-dev-1` and `aaa-dev-2` want to contribute

Each make their own unique changes to the same file and futilely attempt to push. 

Developer 1 assumes their the center of the universe and just goes for it `git push`

```javascript
~/aaa-dev-1/dept-appname # git commit -am 'update README.md'
~/aaa-dev-1/dept-appname # git push
To https://github.com/btomblin/dept-appname.git
 ! [rejected]        master -> master (fetch first)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/btomblin/dept-appname.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes
hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.
```

Developer 2, marginally more intelligent, decides to check for changes on the remote first
```javascript
~/aaa-dev-2/dept-appname # git pull

Developer 1, frustrated, starts to google for answers and learns the flag `--force`

```js
~/aaa-dev-1/dept-appname # git push --force
Enumerating objects: 7, done.
Counting objects: 100% (7/7), done.

 ### Let the blame game begin

 ```btomblin``` where'd my change go? It's missing and there is no record of it, GIT is terrible

 ```aaa-dev-1``` GIT is pretty cool, --force makes it super easy to fix all my problems

 ```aaa-dev-2``` Ugh, why can't we go back to SVN, we didn't have all these confusing problems to deal with, not sure what `btomblin` did wrong, my changes made it, he's probably just a liar

### So what went wrong?

None of these 3 stooges bothered to understand the fundamentals of GIT

- No branching strategy was defined upfront, working straight from ```master``` only works if your the sole contributor to a project
- Nobody bothered to make `master` a **protected** branch, you should never be able to contribute directly to or force push to `master`
- The list goes on & on, this example was an attempt at humor, not a how-to guide

 :warning: **Please understand the GIT basics before continuing**: This is not a beginners guide! :warning:

 :heavy_exclamation_mark: If you have not made, gracefully recovered from these mistakes, and learned from the experience please do so before continuing...you have been warned! :heavy_exclamation_mark:
